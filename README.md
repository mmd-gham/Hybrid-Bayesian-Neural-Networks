Abstract:

Most deep learning models for cancer detection using gene expression data do not quantify uncertainty. This results in unreliability in clinical settings, where understanding the risks associated with detection is crucial for informed decision-making. To address this, we introduce a hybrid Bayesian neural network composed of a multilayer perceptron and Bayesian layers to quantify uncertainty. Our hybrid approach quantifies both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, with total uncertainty averaging 1.133 and 0.271 entropy bits for misclassified and correctly classified samples, respectively. Additionally, our approach achieves high performance in terms of accuracy and recall, with a value of 0.9624.
